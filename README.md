### 🧠 About Me

I'm a **software developer from İzmir, Turkey**, who loved Java enough to change his entire career for it.
For me, **coding is not just logic — it’s art.**
Every line of code is a brushstroke on the canvas of creativity.
My mission is simple: keep learning, keep building, and keep improving every single day. 🚀
