## 🧠 About Me

I'm a software developer from İzmir, Turkey, currently focusing on full-stack JavaScript development.

My journey started with Java and backend fundamentals, where I built a strong understanding of:
**software architecture, data flow, responsibility separation, and clean code principles.**

Today, I'm expanding that foundation into the frontend and full-stack world, working with modern JavaScript technologies while keeping a backend-first mindset.

For me, coding is not just about making things work —  
it's about building systems that are **understandable, scalable, and maintainable.** 🚀
